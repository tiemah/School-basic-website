                 <h2>Brief History of the school</h2>
                 <p>
                    Nakuru Girls High School was started in 1922 when the White Settlers conceived a school for their children at the current location. In the year 1927, the "Nakuru European School" was officially commissioned to cater exclusively for children of the White Settlers from the “Western Region” of the then British Colonial Kenya.
                    Nakuru Girls High School was initially a “European Only” School but With the attainment of independence in the year 1963 and following recommendations of the Otiende Commission, racial segregation was abolished in the schooling system.
                    The Nakuru European School was taken over by the government and ordered to admit students from all the races. Most White Settlers withdrew their children from the school as a result of not wanting their children to learn in the new integrated system.
