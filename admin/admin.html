                 <p>


“If it is to be it is up to me and success is not for the chosen few it is for the few who have chosen”

When it comes to succeeding in life there are three basics mindsets that people tend to have. These are the win/lose mentality, the lose/lose mentality and the win/win mentality. People with a win/lose mentality would be those that compare themselves to other people all the time. They believe that in order for them to succeed others must fail. To them, success is relative.  Those with a lose/lose mentality believe that they can never achieve anything worthwhile so why should they let you do so. They try to keep other people in the sinking boat that they are in, they suffer from pulling other people down syndrome. Negativity is the order of the day for them. Don’t ever try to tell such people that you have great plans for your life,they will only criticize you and tell you it can’t be done.

            <p>


It falls to every successful institutions to seek that precious balance between academics and co- curricular activities. The academics department has served to maintain the academic tempo of the school which has been at an al-time high. It has proved to be the yardstick in comprehending the school’s top mean not only in in the national exams  but also in other competitions that students partake in. it looks deeply into the attendance of the students both during the morning (6:45-6:00a.m) and evening preps(7:00-9:30p.m). The school runs on a system that takes into account the attendance of both the students and teachers during tuition hours as it is well understood that the success of any institution is only as good as the quality of the faculty members. The teachers, needless to say, are the caliber that every student would love to be taught by.
