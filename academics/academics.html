                    Every year, hundreds of thousands of primary school students select to join Nakuru Girls High school as their first choice. However, only 200-300 students are selected based on academic merit and quota as per the education policy. Academic merit is based on performance of the K.C.P.E exams. Its quota system sees to it that the school admits boys from every county in the country though with bias to students from public schools as the current education policy requires.
                    Students are admitted on a need-blind basis. At any given time, there are needy students whose tuition and boarding fees are paid by parties other than their parents or guardians. This is thanks to the schoolâ€™s strong alumni network (the Old Boys Club) as well as the large number of friends the school has around the world.

             <p>
                 Over the years our academic performance as a school has greatly been improving tremendously.In every national exam that has taken place since 2006, when the school was started ,at least ten percent of our students who had sat for the national exainations appeared in the list of the top performing candidates.<br>

                 The school mean has showed an upward trend ever since and this has led to our school being ranked  among the best national schools in a Kenya and also one of the best academic institutions in the East African region.<br>

                 We as a school,continue to make waves all round the country and the globe at large as we work on improving our performance each and every time.We are living upto our slogan which is <i>WE ARE THE BEST IN THE SOUTH OF SAHARA AND THE NORTH OF LIMPOPO.</i>
