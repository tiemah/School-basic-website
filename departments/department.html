         <div class="intro">
             <p>
                 At the school,there are three(3)main departments.They include the science department,mathematics<br> department and the languages department.All these departents work<br> hand in hand in order to achive good performance.
             </p>
         </div>
         <h2>SCIENCE DEPARTMENT</h2>
         <div class="science">
             <img src="../images/scienceDep.jpg">
             <p>
                 The science department comprises of fifteen(15) teachers in total.Of the 15 ,4 teach Physics ,6 teach Biology and 5 teach Chemistry.There are only 5 female teachers in the science department and the rest are male teachers.
                 As a department two of the science subjects are compulsory,which are Biology and Chemistry while Physics is considered to be an optional subject.Over the past few years,the department has registered quite impressive results with a mean of 9.5 recently in the recent national examinations.
             </p>
         </div><hr>
            <h2>LANGUAGES DEPARTMENT</h2>
         <div class="languages">
             <img src="../images/languages.jpeg">
             
             <p>The languages department comprises of four subjects ,two of which are foreign languages.There is English,Kiswahili ,French and German.There are four teachers of English ,three teachers of Kiswahili and one teacher each for French and German respectively.
                 As a department ,the main goal is to bring out students who are eloquent in all the language subjects that they undertake.This will place them on a world map since they can be able to compete at the same level with other students.Therefore ,we as a department count this as an added advantage considering that our students also get to learn foreign languages and be pretty much conversant with each one of them.<br>

                 The HOD ,languages departent has this to say :<br>
                 <q>
                    
                         A man who is fluent in a language is already one step to reaching his dreams.We therefore encourage our students to do their best to master the details of the language since this will increase their competency when they go out there to the world to chase their dreams.
                    
                    </q>
                 </p>   
         </div><hr>
            <h2>MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT</h2>
         <div class="maths">
             <img src="../images/382-3821235_department-of-mathematics-hd-png-download.png">

             <p>
                 The Mathematics department is made up of five(5) teachers.The department has been involved in alot of mathematics contests all round the country.Some of these contests have been a stepping stone to some students who have ended up getting scholarships after performing exceedingly well in the contests.For example ,the MATHLETE organization has sponsored alot of our students who participated in the previous contests.At Nakuru Girls ,Mathematics is a compulsory subject and over the years ,it has registered the highest number of grade A in the nationl examinations.

                 The HOD, Mr.Elijah Oira ,has played a key role in contributing to this performance by acting as a role model.He introduced remedial classes for the eak students in maths and this has achived great improvements .As a department , we aim at ensuring that our students have the necessary skills in every aspect of mathematics.This is because Maths is a key component in our daily lives ,in short it is basically everything that revolves around us.
