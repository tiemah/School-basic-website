                 Co-curricular activities are very importtant in the growth of the body and helps in making the brain more active therefore learning becomes more effective.As a school ,we encourage our students to try as much as possible to engage in games so as to be active in class.
                There are alot of games we have as a school which include the following:
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Basketball</li>
                            <li>Hockey</li>
                            <li>Volleyball</li>
                            <li>Athletics</li>
                            <li>Football</li>
                            <li>Swimming</li>
                        </ul>

                       <p> The school has invested heavily on the games department in different areas such as buying games kit and uniforms for the main teams that normally participate in tournaments.Ensuring that each game or rather each activity has a patron that oversees the trainings and follows up on the tournaments and such activities.</p>

             <p>
                 There are plenty of clubs in the school that cover a wide range of applications including the basics of first aid and treatment.These clubs are necessary to help the students learn and discover new things that are beneficial.For example ,the Guidance and counselling club teaches them how to handle different situation they face from time to time and also how to help each other as side from the academic aspect.This prepares them for the outside world.
                 The Journalism club offers a platform for the students interested in the field of media.Due to this ,they are able to get as much exposure that is needed before they even get to the real world.They can now tackle what comes their way with alot of expectations and confidence.The clubs at the school include the following:
